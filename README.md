# cellular_automata_gallery
This is a simple program I made in MATLAB while learning about how cellular automata are implemented and how they function.

## basic usage
Run the `gui.m` file which opens a window with textboxes and buttons. Select which automaton you want to run, input the parameters needed for it and press the button accompanying it. Another window will open showing the evolution of the automaton. 

## list of automata
- Wolframâ€™s Elementary Automata
- Brian Silverman's Seeds
- Conway's Game of Life (including 7 variations)
- Brian Silverman's Brain
- Wireworld
